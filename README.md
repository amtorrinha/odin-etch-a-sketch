This project consists of a page with an interactable grid of divs of adjustable size.
The user can interact by clicking or hovering on the grid, painting the squares.
There are also random color, shading, reset and eraser features.

With this project I managed to further improve my knowledge on JS-HTML-CSS interactions, whether it may be with Events, accessing HTML attributes or directly modifying CSS styling through JS.
